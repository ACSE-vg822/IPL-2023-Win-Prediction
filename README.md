# IPL-2023-Win-Prediction
In this project, I aimed to predict the outcomes of Indian Premier League (IPL) 2023 cricket matches using historical data from the 2022 season. To achieve this, I built a machine learning model that attempted to learn from past match information to predict future outcomes. However, I faced some challenges due to the limited size of the dataset, which contained only 70 rows of data. This small dataset hindered the model's ability to learn effectively and generalize well to new, unseen data. As a result, the model's performance was not satisfactory. To address this issue, I have decided to start a new analysis using a larger dataset, covering the seasons from 2008 to 2022. This will provide more information for the model to learn from and potentially improve its predictive accuracy.
